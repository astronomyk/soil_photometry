To Do List
==========




Soil composition
----------------
The main soil components are: Air, Water, Minerals, Organics

* Find list of possible soil mineral composition
* Find spectral absorption regions for each mineral
* Get air (O2, N2, CO2) and water absorption (reflection) spectra
* Collate a library of sample soil spectra


Engineering
-----------
* Interference filters for allowing multiple wavelengths ranges per LED to be
  detected
* Find list of LEDs between 0.3um and 5.0um (15um)
* Find list of photo-detectors sensitive to this regime


Science
-------
* Multiply the spectral curves of detector, LED, soil reflection
* Integrate signal
* Look for colour patterns
