Business Plan
=============

Core idea: Miniaturised spectrograph
------------------------------------

Use cases for spectrograph in a soil composition sensor:
- Real time in-situ soil composition measurement
- Land contamination monitoring


Use case: Soil data and management software
--------------------------------------------
Advantages of tracking soil composition in real time include:
- Precision fertiliser application
- Knowing where to plant which crops for best yields
- Precision water management
- Micro-climate
- Identification of dead zones, zones in need of rest


Revenue streams
---------------
- Nutrient maps means more precision land management is possible, resulting in fertiliser / water savings
- Data on soil carbon increases can be used for applying for CO2 credits, which can be sold
- By changing management practices towards regenerative agriculture, further revenue is freed up
    - Less tillage means savings in diesel
    - Healthier soils need less water and fertiliser
    - Higher soil carbon retains more water, resulting in less irrigation
    - Soils are more resilient to drought and flooding, resulting in less crop loss


Use case: Land contamination monitoring
---------------------------------------
- Map contamination levels in brown fields for re-establishing their use as productive economic resources
- Government programs
