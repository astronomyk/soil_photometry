In most soils, **feldspars, micas, and quartz** are the main primary mineral constituents,

* feldspars

  * (x)AlSi3O8 where (x) is one of (K, Na, Ca)

* micas

  * Chemically, micas can be given the general formula[6]

        X Y2-3 Z4 O10 (OH, F)2

    in which:

    * X is K, Na, or Ca or less commonly Ba, Rb, or Cs;
    * Y is Al, Mg, or Fe or less commonly Mn, Cr, Ti, Li, etc.;
    * Z is chiefly Si or Al, but also may include Fe3+ or Ti.

* quartz
  * SiO2
