Annex 1 - Research institute and financial aspects
==================================================
Details on the research institution of the principal investigator
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a joint proposal between working groups from the Department of Astrophysics (IfA) at the University of Vienna (PI institute) and the Institute of Soil Research (IBF) at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU).

Each institute brings specific competencies to the project. Hence the workload will be split thusly:

* IBF Soil sample collection and preparation
* IBF: Soil property measurements (conventional test, NIR spectroscopy)
* IfA: Design of spectro-photometric sensors
* IfA: Construction of sensors
* IBF: Use of sensors
* IfA: Data processing, spectral modelling + fitting to sensor data

Existing personnel
++++++++++++++++++

Existing personnel (not financed by the FWF) bringing expertise to the project

* IfA (Uni Wien)
    * Prof. Alves (PI) - Astronomical instrumentation
    * Dipl.-Ing. Dr Sch√§fer - Technical and practical electronics knowledge
* IBF (BOKU)
    * Prof. Wenzel - Soil and rhizosphere research

Existing infrastructure
+++++++++++++++++++++++
The majority of the equipment needed for conventional soil property measurements will be available through the working group of Prof. Wenzel at the Institute of Soil Research (IBF-BOKU) - see below.

A central piece of equipment, the Vis-NIR spectrograph, is available at the BOKU, however this is located within the Institute for Chemistry of Renewables (ICR). Reflectance spectra for soil samples with the Vis-NIR spectrograph must be paid for by the IBF/IfA via the internal BOKU accounting system.

Summary of existing and accessible equipment
--------------------------------------------
* IBF (BOKU)
    * Mass spectrographs (ICP-OES, ICP-MS)
    * Elemental analyser (CNS)
    * TOC analyser
    * Soil and rhizosphere analysis laboratory, rhizobox devices
    * Greenhouse, access to research farms
* ICR (BOKU)
    * VIS+NIR Spectrograph

List and justification of the personnel costs applied for

1x 50% post-doctoral position over 18 months (i.e. 0.75 FTEs)

The 18 month time-frame has been chosen so that soil samples may be taken from the research farms during all seasons. This will allow a larger range of "natural" conditions to be sampled in the parameter space.

It is expected that the post-doctoral researcher will conduct the following tasks in consultation with Prof. Wenzel (IBF) and Prof. Alves (IfA):

* Define the soil property parameter space to be investigated
* Select the array of LEDs to be built into the photometric sensor test rack
* Prepare soil samples for a characteristic set of points in the defined parameter space
* For each soil sample in the parameter space:
* Determine soil properties using conventional soil testing methods
* Acquire reflectance spectra using the Vis+NIR spectrograph
* Acquire reflectance measurements from the photometric sensor
* Generate synthetic spectral models based on known properties of the soil
* Determine the degree of correlation between the spectral models, measured NIR-spectra, conventionally determined property values, and photometric reflectance measurements
* Find and exclude redundant contaminating spectral tracer wavelengths
* Iterate over the sensor rack design to improve the performance of the LED array
* Publish the results and spectral library in an open-access journal

The ideal candidate for this position is Dr Kieran Leschinski, currently employed at the IfA (Uni Wien). Dr Leschinski has over five years experience with Visual+NIR instrumentation design, spectro-photometric measurement techniques, synthetic spectral modelling, and optics simulations.

List and justification of the equipment costs applied for
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The equipment costs are split between two major pieces of equipment:

* Use of the Vis-NIR spectrograph at the Institute of Chemistry of Renewables (BOKU)
* Design and construction of a Vis-NIR spectro-photometer test rack

Use of the BOKU (ICR) NIR spectrometer - EUR 8000

* For this project we will need to use the NIR spectrometer located at the Institute of Chemistry of Renewables (ICR) at BOKU. The final cost for the use of the spectrometer is roughly based on the number of samples measured with the instrument. From previous experience, the internal accounting equates to approximately EUR 20 (brutto) per sample. Given that we intend to measure the reflectance spectrum of approximately 400 soil samples, we will require approximately EUR 8000 for the use of this instrument (see below for the calculation of number of soil samples).

Construction of spectro-photometric sensor - EUR 4800

* The spectro-photometric sensor must be designed and built from scratch. It is currently unclear whether the in-house resources at the IfA will be sufficient for this task (due to retirement of staff). If not, we will need to out-source the design and construction of the sensor test rack. An informal quote from MH-Designs (https://www.mhd-pcb.de/) (see attached PDF) estimated a rough cost of EUR 3000 for the labour involved, and EUR 1000 for the electronic components, for a total of EUR 4800 (incl 20% VAT). If the in-house resources at the IfA indeed prove to be sufficient, then only the electronic components will need to be purchased, at a cost of approx. EUR 1000. We however ask for EUR 4800 due to the uncertainty around the IfA staffing arrangements.

List and justification of the material costs applied for
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Consumable materials costs for conventional soil properties tests - EUR 2800

* The equipment for determining soil properties using conventional methods is already available at the Institute for Soil Research (IBF). Consequently the only costs associated with determining the soil properties using these methods are the consumable material costs. From prior experience, a conservative estimate is approximately EUR 7 (brutto) per sample for the full range of soil properties. For the 400 soil samples, we will require approximately EUR 2800 (see below for the calculation of number of soil samples).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No other costs are foreseen for this project.

Addendum: Justification for number of soil samples
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For Phase 2 we will have a minimum of 125 soil samples. This comes from the fact that we wish to model the interdependencies of each of the 3 major soil properties (%water, pH, SOC) on the reflectance spectrum. To do so we must measure the reflectance spectrum for each property at 5 different levels within a set minimum and maximum realistic range. The full 3D parameter space requires a grid of 5^3 soil samples (i.e. 125 samples). Each of the soil samples requires a NIR spectrum as well as the set of soil properties determined by conventional methods.

For Phase 3 the number of soil samples will depend on the strength of the interdependencies found in Phase 2. However, given that we estimate Phase 3 to last twice as long as Phase 2, and that each of the soil properties in Phase 3 likely has a dependency on one or more of the Phase 2 properties, it is safe to assume that we will have at least 250 extra soil samples for Phase 3. This equates to upwards of 375 in total. Hence we round to 400 samples for the ease of calculations.
